# Lost & Found - Advanced Face Recognition System

## Overview
Lost & Found is a best-in-class face recognition system designed for real-time identification, video analysis, and database management. Built with modern AI and web technologies, it provides a seamless workflow for uploading, processing, and recognizing faces from images, videos, and live camera feeds.

## üöÄ Workflow
1. **Upload Media**: Users can upload images or videos via the web interface.
2. **Face Enrollment**: New faces are enrolled into the database with metadata and images.
3. **Live Camera Recognition**: Activate the laptop camera for real-time face recognition.
4. **Face Matching**: The system detects and matches faces using deep learning and vector search.
5. **Database Management**: View, update, and manage enrolled faces and their metadata.
6. **Analytics & Monitoring**: Access system health, performance, and recognition analytics.
